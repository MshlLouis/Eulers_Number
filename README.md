# A Rust program to calculate Eulers Number e


## 1: Notes

Pretty much my first/second project in Rust, translated from Java. Very inefficient, ~~500.000 decimals in 10 seconds~~  ~~1.000.000 decimals in 10 seconds~~ ~1.600.000 decimals in 10 seconds, runtime complexity O(n^2). Might improve in the future or not idk

## 2: How To Use

Use either Spigot_Algorithm.rs or Infinite_Series.rs to calculate e. Infinite_Series.rs is a lot more efficient.
