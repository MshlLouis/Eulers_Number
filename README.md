# A Rust program to calculate Eulers Number e


## 1: Notes

Pretty much my first/second project in Rust, translated from Java. Very inefficient, ~~~500.000 decimals in 10 seconds~~ now ~1.000.000 decimals in 10 seconds, runtime complexity O(n^2). Might improve in the future or not idk

## 2: How To Use

Use either Spigot_Algorithm.rs or Infinite_Series.rs to calculate e. First algorithm is slower, but prints out the actual number, while the second algorithm only calculates the numerator and denominator. Use file calculateNumber.java to calculate e.
